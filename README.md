I had the privilege of redesigning the digital home of **Tanjore Degree Coffee**, a beloved brand known for its authentic South Indian filter coffee and refreshing rose milk. Our mission was to blend **tradition with technology**â€”crafting a minimalist yet modern web experience that pays tribute to the brandâ€™s rich legacy.

This website redesign features:

-  **Smooth parallax scrolling** for a dynamic and immersive browsing experience  
-  **Interactive hover effects and animated buttons** to enhance user engagement  
-  **Fully responsive layouts**, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop users  
-  **Visual storytelling** with curated images and video content  
-  **Performance optimizations** for lightning-fast loading speeds  
-  **Advanced SEO integration** for better search engine discoverability  

> My goal was to build a digital experience as rich and memorable as a cup of Tanjore Degree Coffee itself. â˜•
